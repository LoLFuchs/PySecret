# PySecret

PySecret is a fully in Python written, de-/ and encoder. 

It works with a save "key symbol system" (kss). 
The key is a very long combination of unique charackters, so that there are unlimited combinations. 

Example Key: 
```
jÔôäiá,_b.g(Íéó$"0rtRomÄLfJ)=w§Â°HCBÜ1íûPNQ;u &G2pYîI#c6T-ÎeVZU9l<Oay€öÁÉ8Ö74!Xx*+[3Ahú@ßâMs:W/Süê?%]zF5ÓvDdkEÚ>nÊqK
```

## Setup 
First you have to install all requirement packages and Python 

Install 
```
pip install requirements.txt 
```
or 
```
pip install tkinter
pip install pyperclip
pip install Pillow
```
since V1.0

## Start
When you downloaded the last realease, you just open the main.py

Open 
```
main.py
``` 
After that, we recommend to generate a default key 

``` 
Start -> Settings -> renew -> submit
``` 
since V1.0 

## write
default key: you only go to write and enter the text you want to encrypt. 

no default key: you can enter a key next to the text you want to enter. 

## read
default key: If you haven an encrypted text, with the right default key, you just enter the text and get the decrypted text. 

no default key: You´ll have to enter the key under the encrypted text, in the "key" label. If you enterd both you also get the decrypted text.
